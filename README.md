# raspidisp

This is a fun project written in Lua using the Raspberry PI touch screen as a dashboard displaying more or less useless information:

- A webcam picture
- Date and time
- Status and uptime of my Raspberry Pi computers
- Weather forcast
- Some value from temperaturs sensors

If you are interested in more details on how it works, see [here](https://cloud.hebbie.de/raspi-dashboard/).
